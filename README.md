# Messaging_App
ReactJS web app created using "chatengine.io" powered by "react-chat-engine" package. Anyone can login with their username and password to the Messaging web app and start messaging in the group chat. Admin has the privilege to add users to groups and create groups. Users have the option to send messages and images to the chat thread. The username and password will be saved to the "local storage" just so the user does not have to log-in again and again for the next time.
